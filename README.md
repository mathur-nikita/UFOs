# UFOs 

## Overview of UFOs Project

For this project, Dana has been given the opportunity to write an article on the topic of UFOs.  The information on UFO sightings is contained in a JavaScipt file, and Dana would like to use this file to create an HTML page that not only presents her article, but also displays a dynamic table of the UFO sightings.  The table will have filters that will update sightings information as a user enters specific search criteria.

Dana would like to have the table of findings have filters for the following information:
1) Date of UFO sighting
2) City where the UFO was seen
3) State where the UFO was seen
4) Country where the UFO was seen
5) Shape of the UFO seen
